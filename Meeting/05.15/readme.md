Meeting Method: Google Meet
1. Regarding the completion of the use case diagram and requirements definition document
→ We would like to gather and receive feedback on the requirements definition document during the mentor-led meeting on 5/27. (We will ensure to present the final version at this meeting)
→ There was a suggestion to ask the mentor about the method of creating use case diagrams during the mentor-led meeting, as not everyone is familiar with it yet.

2. About the Udemy course schedule
→ Until the end of the term, we plan to complete 2 to 3 lectures per week considering their lengths, and after the term ends, we will aim to complete 4 to 5 lectures per week.
→ I will make sure to add the precise course schedule and progress status at the end of our meeting minutes every week.

3. Regarding the field of study and the technical area/paper you want to read (Content of the mentor-led meeting presentation)
→ For now, we have decided on the broad topic of 'Deep Learning', and we plan to choose a more specific subject to study after reading papers related to security technologies based on deep learning.

Future plan
- By midnight on Monday (the day after tomorrow) -> Look for papers on deep learning-based defense technologies and identify what deep learning technologies may be needed
- Tuesday to Wednesday (midnight) -> Search for reference papers and learning resources based on specific deep learning technologies
- Wednesday to Friday morning -> Complete the presentation materials and share them in the chat room
