Preventive Adversarial Attack Project

## Project Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems harbor security loopholes that pose an imminent threat to user safety. Consequently, we find ourselves in an era that demands the defense of AI systems from malicious adversaries.

In this project, we aim to undertake research on adversarial AI attacks and defense mechanisms for autonomous ships while concurrently implementing them. Adversarial AI attacks entail deliberately crafting adversarial samples to disrupt and launch an assault on the opponent's AI system. This method is capable of deploying various lethal attack techniques that undermine the integrity of AI systems. The propulsion system of autonomous ships is particularly vulnerable to connectivity issues that arise from integrating and navigating weather patterns such as wave states, rainfall or strong winds, as well as the position and path of surrounding vessels. Such vulnerabilities, if left unattended, could cause navigational challenges for autonomous ships. This project, therefore, seeks to prevent such circumstances and contribute towards accelerating the pace of automation in the maritime industry
