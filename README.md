Preventive Adversarial Attack Project

## Project Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems harbor security loopholes that pose an imminent threat to user safety. Consequently, we find ourselves in an era that demands the defense of AI systems from malicious adversaries.

In this project, we aim to undertake research on adversarial AI attacks and defense mechanisms for autonomous ships while concurrently implementing them. Adversarial AI attacks entail deliberately crafting adversarial samples to disrupt and launch an assault on the opponent's AI system. This method is capable of deploying various lethal attack techniques that undermine the integrity of AI systems. The propulsion system of autonomous ships is particularly vulnerable to connectivity issues that arise from integrating and navigating weather patterns such as wave states, rainfall or strong winds, as well as the position and path of surrounding vessels. Such vulnerabilities, if left unattended, could cause navigational challenges for autonomous ships. This project, therefore, seeks to prevent such circumstances and contribute towards accelerating the pace of automation in the maritime industry

## Background and Necessity of the Proposal
Over 95% of Korea's import and export cargo is transported by sea, highlighting the crucial role that maritime transport plays in the country's development. Autonomous ships are the next generation of high-value vessels that combine all digital core technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and sensors, to self-determine the optimal route and navigate independently.

AI technology, a core component of autonomous navigation, employs data and knowledge to implement high-level human abilities such as perception, learning, and inference. Machine learning, deep learning, and other AI technologies support unmanned/autonomous shipping by processing vast amounts of data generated by autonomous vessels.

Now, for the safety of autonomous ships, it is necessary to focus not only on the cybersecurity of ship systems but also on the cybersecurity of AI technology. The Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Energy and the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries have established a task force to develop autonomous ships, with approximately KRW 160 billion allocated for development until 2025. Therefore, this research project could provide excellent opportunities to promote growth that aligns with trends in maritime logistics.
