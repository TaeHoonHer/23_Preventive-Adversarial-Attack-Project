# 23_Preventive-Adversarial-Attack-Project
Preventive Adversarial Attack Project

## Project Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems harbor security loopholes that pose an imminent threat to user safety. Consequently, we find ourselves in an era that demands the defense of AI systems from malicious adversaries.

In this project, we aim to undertake research on adversarial AI attacks and defense mechanisms for autonomous ships while concurrently implementing them. Adversarial AI attacks entail deliberately crafting adversarial samples to disrupt and launch an assault on the opponent's AI system. This method is capable of deploying various lethal attack techniques that undermine the integrity of AI systems. The propulsion system of autonomous ships is particularly vulnerable to connectivity issues that arise from integrating and navigating weather patterns such as wave states, rainfall or strong winds, as well as the position and path of surrounding vessels. Such vulnerabilities, if left unattended, could cause navigational challenges for autonomous ships. This project, therefore, seeks to prevent such circumstances and contribute towards accelerating the pace of automation in the maritime industry

## Background and Necessity of the Proposal
Over 95% of Korea's import and export cargo is transported by sea, highlighting the crucial role that maritime transport plays in the country's development. Autonomous ships are the next generation of high-value vessels that combine all digital core technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and sensors, to self-determine the optimal route and navigate independently.

AI technology, a core component of autonomous navigation, employs data and knowledge to implement high-level human abilities such as perception, learning, and inference. Machine learning, deep learning, and other AI technologies support unmanned/autonomous shipping by processing vast amounts of data generated by autonomous vessels.

Now, for the safety of autonomous ships, it is necessary to focus not only on the cybersecurity of ship systems but also on the cybersecurity of AI technology. The Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Energy and the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries have established a task force to develop autonomous ships, with approximately KRW 160 billion allocated for development until 2025. Therefore, this research project could provide excellent opportunities to promote growth that aligns with trends in maritime logistics.

## Project Topic
- The focus of this project is on researching adversarial AI attacks and defense mechanisms for autonomous ships. Specifically, we aim to identify security vulnerabilities in AI systems used for autonomous ships, detect and defend against adversarial AI attacks. Our ultimate goal is to ensure the safety of autonomous ships by developing robust defense technologies against adversarial AI.

- To begin, we will analyze the four main types of adversarial AI attacks (poisoning, evasion, model extraction, and data extraction) that commonly occur in AI systems. We will also examine the system architecture of autonomous ships and identify potential security weaknesses. In addition, we will collect information from ocean sensors such as AIS, RADAR, audio, and camera data to train generator and discriminator models using GANs to generate adversarial examples and detect them.

- Based on the above research, we will develop defensive technologies to block and defend against adversarial AI attacks. We plan to expand our efforts by creating an application that receives real-time data from autonomous ships, evaluates AI image and video recognition results, and notifies the coastal control center when an attack is detected. Ultimately, our project aims to enhance the safety and security of autonomous ships through advanced research and innovative defense strategies against adversarial AI attacks.

## Background/Importance
Currently, the development of autonomous vessels is actively underway with a budget of approximately 160 billion won allocated by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy and the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries until 2025. To further advance this technology, it is essential to establish an AI security system. The driving mechanism of autonomous vessels involves detecting and connecting wave conditions, weather environment such as rain or strong wind, as well as the position and path of surrounding vessels for navigation. Therefore, any vulnerability in connectivity can result in problems with autonomous navigation. In addition, user safety may also be compromised by security vulnerabilities. As autonomous driving technology is still relatively new, there is a high possibility of security vulnerabilities. This can pose a threat to user safety. A prime example is the 2015 case where a security vulnerability was discovered in the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' cars, which were then hacked, compromising user safety. Hackers were able to remotely take control of the vehicle and manipulate it, such as turning off the engine or reducing acceleration. Such incidents demonstrate that security vulnerabilities in autonomous navigation can directly affect user safety through hacking attacks. Therefore, countermeasures for security vulnerabilities are necessary, and various security technologies and procedures must be strictly followed

If problems occur with autonomous vessels as described above, it will not only harm the industry and companies but also negatively impact national competitiveness. As the shipping industry accounts for 90% of the global logistics volume, the impact of such incidents goes beyond the industry and companies to affect the overall development of global logistics. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to the establishment of a security system for autonomous vessels, accelerate the development and commercialization of autonomous vessel technology, and ultimately promote the overall development of global logistics from a broader perspective

- To develop defense capabilities for adversarial attacks on ships, the following process will be undertaken. First, the training data for both the attacker and defender will be updated. Next, adversarial attack examples will be uploaded to clean data to assess whether the resulting changes are detectable by human observation, which will be verified through crowd-sourcing. Finally, a DNN (Deep Neural Network) will be generated as a defense strategy, and testing will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the defense

- The presented results demonstrate the generation of adversarial examples for the MNIST dataset, verifying the vulnerability of the model. Each image includes a visual representation of the generated adversarial example, and the comparison of the model's predictions for the original and adversarial images in a bar graph, allowing for a visual understanding of how adversarial examples can alter the model's predictions.

- By executing adversarial attacks on the digits 7 and 3, it was possible to successfully manipulate the model to recognize the digit 7 as a 5, and increase the probability of the digit 3 being recognized as a 2 while maintaining its shape, as demonstrated in the results.

- The autonomous vessel sends real-time data to an application as it navigates through online and interconnected systems. Through the app, users can visually analyze the data from the autonomous vessel's journey and immediately verify whether or not it is well-protected against adversarial attacks. Additional features include an alarm function that alerts users when the vessel is under attack, as well as the ability to create and train adversarial attack samples using the sample generator depicted in the left-hand example image. The sample generator allows users to collect data related to the vessel's navigation, such as its coordinates and the distance between the vessel and other objects, while in operation, enabling them to create adversarial attack samples. With this, we expect the program to play a role similar to that of an antivirus program in protecting the vessel against adversarial attacks

- Intentionally adding a slight amount of noise to a normal image can cause AI to misclassify it and perceive it as a completely different shape. While humans may hardly notice the difference between the image before and after the tampering, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial AI attacks and can confidently misclassify the two images as different pictures. By training and practicing with existing adversarial AI samples, expected results can be derived.

- Effective defense implementation against adversarial AI attacks and monitoring/protective features against such attacks are necessary in case of becoming a victim of adversarial AI attacks.
